In this project, I used PySpark to build a machine learning model on a set of Amazon reviews. 
I built a logistic regression model that reads user-generated reviews to predict whether the review was rated good (4 or 5 stars) or bad (3 stars or less).![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98540685/208122163-3ae09091-7577-4eeb-9e25-e7960f0e4ce1.png)
